# Overview

## Purpose

We are visualizing and mapping earthquake data using JS and APIs. Leaflet helps us populate geographical map with geoJson data from a website.

Below is a streets view of the earthquake data:

Here we have a satelite view of our earthquake data:

and lastly we have our dark view option:

Each version of the map allows you to toggle on/off options to see tectonic plates (purple line), all earthquakes, or if you would like to see only major earthquakes.
